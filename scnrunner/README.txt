This project is a prototype for studying the feasibility and capabilities of distributed computing using mobile devices.

raspberry4-dewsim-server: is a subproject which includes scripts to make a dew computing context setup easy. It also has a server which keeps running and communicates with mobile devices attached to the dew context as well as job schedulers implementations for exploiting devices computing capabilities.

raspberry_pi_dogs_detection: is a subproject which holds a concrete running application example. In this case, an object recognition using video streams.

Find detailed instructions for running the whole prototype in subprojects folders.
